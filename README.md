## Topics Covered

- **DBMS vs RDBMS vs NoSQL (NRDBMS)**: Understanding different types of database systems, their architecture, and when to use themâ€”covering structured and unstructured data models.
- **Keys in SQL**: Exploring `Primary`, `Foreign`, `Candidate`, `Composite` among other keys that maintain data accuracy and define relationships between tables.
- **Data Types**: Overview of MySQL data types like `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `BOOLEAN`, etc., used to specify the kind of data each column holds.

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` used to define or modify database schema.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Commands such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` that modify the data in tables.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Statements like `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to control access and permissions in the database.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: Managing transactions using `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT` to ensure data consistency and integrity.
- **DQL (Data Query Language)**: Primarily the `SELECT` statement used to fetch data from one or more tables.

- **Basic Queries**: Writing simple to complex `SELECT` queries using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, etc.
- **Functions**: Applying MySQL functions such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `NOW()`, `CONCAT()` for data processing.
- **Wildcards**: Using pattern matching with `LIKE`, `%`, `_` to filter results flexibly.
- **UNION**: Combining results from multiple `SELECT` statements into a single result set.
- **Joins**: Integrating data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, etc.
- **Nested Queries**: Using subqueries inside other queries to perform complex operations and filtering.
- **Triggers**: Automating responses to database events like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.
